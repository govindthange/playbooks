## ðŸ™‹ **Strategy 2.** For extraordinary candidates, utilise wildcard entries.

Any profile that offers to showcase a strong full-stack Github project should be given preference. This goes in conjunction with strategy 1.

# ðŸ¤· What steps do we take after analysing a candidate via an online test?

1. Based on their online test results, we rank the applicants.
2. On the basis of high and low scores, we establish a cut-off and screen candidates for the PI round.
3. The PI round will be conducted as per the interviewers liking.
4. Interviewer fills the evaluation sheet and submits it to the HR.

> Most of the time, we just permit one PI round before closing the position.
