- **Assess Data Modeling Capabilities:** Add MCQs to examine database modeling skills w/ ER Diagrams.
- **Assess Module Design Capabilities:** Add MCQs to examine knowledge of UML diagrams & flowchart notations.
- **Assess Bare Minimum DevOps Capabilities:** Add MCQs to examine...
  - svn/git proficiency, including the ability to fork, tag, branch, rebase, commit with a patch, cherry-pick, etc.
  - Knowledge of Build & deployment tools.

### âœ¨ Test for **8+ Years** experienced candidates

Create a medium-level MCQ test to assess candidate's knowledge of the following subjects:

- **Assess Code Review Capabilities:** Add MCQs to examine...
  - Coding principles, such as DRY, SOLID, KISS, SOC, YAGNI, MVP, IoC. This knowledge is essential for doing proper code reviews.
  - Data security & encryption.

- Software development methodologies, such as SDLC, TDD, Agile/Scrum, Domain Driven Design (DDD) etc.
- Reading comprehension using a short passage.

## ðŸ™‹ **Strategy 2.** For extraordinary candidates, utilise wildcard entries.

Any profile that offers to showcase a strong full-stack Github project should be given preference. This goes in conjunction with strategy 1.

# ðŸ¤· What steps do we take after analysing a candidate via an online test?

1. Based on their online test results, we rank the applicants.
2. On the basis of high and low scores, we establish a cut-off and screen candidates for the PI round.
3. There will only be a single PI round. Only on a case-by-case basis and to the interviewers' preferences would the multiple PI round be undertaken.
4. Interviewer fills the evaluation sheet and submits it to the HR.

> Most of the time, we just permit one PI round before closing the position.
