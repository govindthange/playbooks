# ðŸ¤· How could hiring of `developers` be made more effective and fast?

> We run entrance exams and screen candidates using software platforms for `Remote Online Assessments` and `Virtual Interviews`.

## ðŸ™‹ Stragtegy 1. Conduct entrance exams using online platforms.

### âœ¨ Test for `0-2 Years` experienced candidates

Prepare a very simple MCQ test to evaluate following aspects:

- Aptitude (Serious interns and freshmen do this preparation).
- Core Data Structures, DBMS and OO/Functional/Procedural programming concepts.
- Understanding basic code snippets.

### âœ¨ Test for `2-5 Years` experienced candidates

Prepare an easy to solve MCQ test to assess following areas of the candidate's knowledge:

- Basic coding principles, such as DRY and SOLID. Understanding of these principles suggests that the candidate has worked under good supervision.
- Understanding of the chosen programming languages, such as Java, C#, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, PL/SQL, C/C++, Go, Python, Shell Scripting, etc.
- Understanding basic code snippets.
- Use of the basic programming constructs such as exception handling, logging, interfaces etc.
- Basic SVN/GIT commands to create commit, pull, fetch, checkout etc.
- Creating builds and deployments.

### âœ¨ Test for `5+ Years` experienced candidates

Prepare a medium-level MCQ test to gauge the candidate's knowledge in following areas:

- Coding principles, such as DRY, SOLID, KISS, SOC, YAGNI, MVP, IoC. This knowledge is essential for doing proper code reviews.
- Proper understanding of the chosen programming languages, such as Java, C#, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, PL/SQL, C/C++, Go, Python, Shell Scripting, etc.
- Advanced SVN/GIT commands to do fork, tag, branch, rebase, commit w/ patch, cherry-pick etc.
- Build & deployment tools.
- Database modeling w/ ERD.
- UML Diagrams & Flowcharts.

### âœ¨ Test for `8+ Years` experienced candidates

Create a medium-level MCQ test to assess candidate's knowledge of the following subjects:

- Coding principles, such as DRY, SOLID, KISS, SOC, YAGNI, MVP, IoC. This knowledge is essential for doing proper code reviews.
- Software development methodologies, such as SDLC, TDD, Agile/Scrum etc.
- Database modeling w/ ERD.
- UML diagrams & flowcharts.
- Design patterns.
- Basic understanding of REST APIs, XML over HTTP, Messaging.
- Architectural styles such as microservices architecture.
- Common patterns of creating version control branch structure.
- Data security & encryption.
- Cloud computing & DevOps (Optional).
- Reading comprehension using a short passage.

## ðŸ™‹ Strategy 2. For extraordinary candidates, utilise wildcard entries.

Any profile that offers to highlight a strong full-stack Github project should be given preference. This goes in conjunction with strategy 1.

# ðŸ¤· What steps do we take after analysing a candidate via an online test?

1. Based on their online test results, we rank the applicants.
2. On the basis of high and low scores, we establish a cut-off and screen candidates for the PI round.

> Most of the time, we just permit one PI round before closing the position.
